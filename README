This is a tool to display and annotate large sensor data sets.
It is developed in a research project of the TU Braunschweig.

Dependencies
------------
You need
  - A python interpreter
  - pygtk
  - gst-python
  - matplotlib
  - context-common

How to run
----------
Set the PYTHONPATH variable so that it contains the path to your context-common installation. Then you can just execute main.py with your python interpreter. On my system that looks like this:

    PYTHONPATH="../context-common" python main.py
